# ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Deployment: PHP Web Application on AWS

> üö® **Note:** This project demonstrates my ability to deploy a secure, cloud-native PHP application on AWS using EC2, RDS, VPC, and related services.  
> The application used is open-source and credited below. My contribution lies in designing the infrastructure and successfully deploying the system end-to-end.

## üìå Project Overview

This deployment simulates a real-world production setup of a PHP-based **Student Management System** hosted on AWS, with an emphasis on secure architecture, hands-on networking, and CLI-driven configuration.

### üîß Stack Highlights:
- **Amazon EC2** ‚Äì For hosting the PHP web server
- **Amazon RDS** ‚Äì For storing student records in a MySQL DB
- **Custom VPC** ‚Äì With public/private subnets, route tables, and internet gateway
- **Manual SQL Import** ‚Äì From EC2 to RDS via MySQL CLI
- **End-to-end Testing** ‚Äì Browser access, DB connection validation, and data verification

### üó∫Ô∏è Infrastructure Layout:
- Public subnet ‚Üí EC2 instance (Web Server)
- Private subnet ‚Üí RDS instance (MySQL)
- Separate private subnet ‚Üí Standby/AZ2
- Internet Gateway + NAT routing
- Custom security groups for HTTP, SSH, and DB access

## üöÄ Deployment Steps (Summary)

1. **VPC & Subnet Setup**
   - CIDR Block: `10.0.0.0/24`
   - 3 Subnets (1 public, 2 private across AZs)

2. **Routing & Internet Access**
   - Attached Internet Gateway to public subnet
   - Created custom route tables for public/private traffic

3. **EC2 Instance Configuration**
   - Installed Apache, PHP, and MySQL client
   - Cloned project via Git and configured `config.php`

4. **RDS Setup**
   - Private subnet placement, custom SG
   - Whitelisted EC2 in DB SG for secure access

5. **App + Database Integration**
   - Imported `.sql` into RDS via MySQL CLI
   - Verified connection and data flow via UI

## üôè Credits

This project uses the open-source **Student Management System** from [PHP Gurukul](https://phpgurukul.com/student-management-system-using-php-and-mysql/).  
All rights and content belong to the respective authors. I used the code solely for deployment and infrastructure demonstration purposes.

## üßπ Cleanup & Cost Note

After successful deployment and testing, **all AWS resources were deleted** to avoid incurring further cloud charges.  
As this was a **learning-focused, non-commercial project**, every component was manually cleaned up via the AWS Console.

## ‚úÖ Outcome

- Designed and deployed a secure 3-tier architecture
- Connected PHP app to MySQL RDS via private subnets
- Validated app functionality and DB communication
- Practiced real-world deployment, networking, and troubleshooting skills
